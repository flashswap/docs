# Docs

This is the lending pool protocol documentation. It details the smart contract interfaces and the Solidity ABI. 
Further details will be added to this documentation during the upcoming weeks.

## Smart contract structure

## ABI


### Actions

```
    function deposit(address _reserve, uint _amount) public payable

```
Allows the deposit of the asset identified by the _reserve_ address with the specified amount.

```
    function withdraw(address _reserve, uint _amount) public 
    
```

Allows the withdrawal of the asset identified by _reserve_ with the specified amount.

```
    function borrow(address _reserve, uint _amount, uint _interestRateMode) public
```

InterestRateMode is defined with the following Enumerative:


```
   enum InterestRateMode{
        FIXED,
        VARIABLE
    }
```

Allows to borrow the specified asset with the specified amount and the specified interest rate mode, as long as the caller previously deposited enough collateral to cover the borrowing.

```
    function repay(address _reserve, uint _amount, address _onBehalfOf) public payable
```

Allows the caller to repay (either for himself or on behalf of another address) a specific borrowing. Note: _onBehalfOf_ needs to be equal to msg.sender when the caller wants to repay for himself.

```
    function swapBorrowRateMode(address _reserve) public 
    
```

Allows the caller to swap his borrowing interest rate mode from fixed to variable, or vice versa.

```
    function collateralCall(address _collateral, address _user, uint _purchaseAmount, address _reserve) public payable

```

Execute collateral call on a specific asset for a specific account, is the collateral price in ETH is below the liquidation threshold.


### Solidity Accessors

```
    function getReserveData(address _reserve) external view returns(
        uint totalLiquidity,
        uint availableLiquidity,
        uint totalBorrowsFixed, //total amount borrowed on a fixed rate
        uint totalBorrowsVariable, //total amount borrowed on a variable rate
        uint liquidityRate, //depositors APR (in rays)
        uint variableBorrowRate, //variable borrows APR (in rays)
        uint fixedBorrowRate, //current fixed borrow rate (in rays)
        uint averageFixedBorrowRate, //weighted average rate of all the fixed rate borrows  
        uint utilizationRate,
        uint liquidityIndex, //cumulation index of the depositors interest for the whole reserve
        uint variableBorrowIndex) //cumulation index of the variable borrowers interest for the whole reserve
```

Allows to fetch all the data related to a specific reserve.

```

    function getUserGlobalData(address _user) external view returns(
        uint totalLiquidityETH, //total liquidity deposited by _user, in ETH
        uint totalBorrowsETH, //total amount borrowed by _user, in ETH
        uint currentLiquidationRatio, //average liquidation ratio on the borrows
        uint ltv, //current average LTV based on the collaterals deposited by the user
        bool isBelowLiquidationThreshold) //if the borrowing is below liquidation threshold 
```

Fetches the user global data (data across all the reserves)
 
 ```
 
    function getUserReserveData(address _reserve, address _user) external view returns(
        uint currentLiquidityBalance, //total deposits for _reserve (includes compounded interest)
        uint currentBorrowBalance, //total borrows for _reserve (includes compounded interest)
        uint principalLiquidityBalance, //original amount deposited by _user
        uint principalBorrowBalance, //original amount borrowed by _user
        uint borrowRateMode, //if the current borrow rate mode is fixed or variable
        uint borrowRate, //current rate (might be fixed or variable depending on borrowratemode)
        uint liquidityRate, //current liquidity rate on the deposits
        uint originationFee, //origination fee cumulated from the borrows
        uint liquidityIndex, //cumulation index at the moment of the deposit
        uint variableBorrowIndex)  //cumulation index at the moment of the borrow (only for variable borrowings)
        
 ```
 
 Fetches the user data for a specific reserve.
 

## REST API
 
A set of REST API is provided to support protocol integrations. These endpoints allow to fetch the data from the smart contracts in a easy way and automatically generate the transactions to perform actions.
  
### GET
 
 
#### Pool Reserves

```
 
 /data/reserves
 
 ``` 
 Fetches the data of all the reserves.
 
 returns an array of:
 
 ```
 {
    address	//address of the reserve
    name	//name of the reserve
    symbol	//symbol of the reserve
    totalLiquidity	//total liquidity in currency units
    availableLiquidity	//available liquidity in currency units
    totalBorrows	//total borrowed in currency units
    totalBorrowsFixed //total fixed in currency units
    totalBorrowsVariable //total variable in currency units
    liquidityRate //current liquidity interest (in percentage)
    variableBorrowRate	//current variable borrow rate (in percentage)
    fixedBorrowRate	//current fixed borrow rate (in percentage)
    utilizationRate	//current utilization rate
}
``` 

#### User Account Information

```
/data/user/:userAddress

```
returns:

```
{
    totalLiquidityBalanceETH //total deposits of the user, in ETH
    totalBorrowBalanceETH	//total borrowed by the user, in ETH
    totalLiquidityBalanceUSD	//total deposits in USD
    totalBorrowBalanceUSD	//total borrowed in USD
    ltv	"105" //current average loan to value calculated on the deposited collaterals
    liquidationRatio //current average liquidation ratio calculated on the deposited collaterals

    reservesData[] {	//details for all the reserves where the user borrowed/deposited something. Note: example values below
        currentLiquidityBalance	
        currentBorrowBalance	"6443.541666666666665"

        borrowRate	"20.00"
        liquidityRate	"8.83"

    }
}
```

### POST

All the post actions that can be executed return a transaction object with the following interface:

```
interface EthereumTransactionModelI {
  from: string;
  to: string;
  data?: string;
  gas?: string;
  value?: string;
}
```

The transaction object received can be then signed and submitted by the caller.

```
/actions/borrow
```
payload for the action is:

```
{
    userAddress, //address of the caller
    reserve, //address of the reserve
    amount, //amount in currency units
    interestRateMode //interest rate mode, can be 0 (fixed) or 1 (variable)
 }
```

```
/actions/deposit

```
payload for the action is:

```
{
    userAddress, //address of the caller
    reserve, //address of the reserve
    amount, //amount in currency units
 }

```

```

```
{
    userAddress, //address of the caller
    reserve, //address of the reserve
    amount, //amount in currency units
 }

```

```

```
{
    userAddress, //address of the caller
    reserve, //address of the reserve
